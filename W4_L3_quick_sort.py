# Python program for implementation of Quicksort Sort

# This implementation utilizes pivot as the last element in the nums list
# It has a pointer to keep track of the elements smaller than the pivot
# At the very end of partition() function, the pointer is swapped with the pivot
# to come up with a "sorted" nums relative to the pivot


def partition(l, r, nums):
	# Last element will be the pivot and the first element the pointer
	pivot, ptr = nums[r], l
	for i in range(l, r):
		if nums[i] <= pivot:
			# Swapping values smaller than the pivot to the front
			nums[i], nums[ptr] = nums[ptr], nums[i]
			ptr += 1
	# Finally swapping the last element with the pointer indexed number
	nums[ptr], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[ptr]
	return ptr

# With quicksort() function, we will be utilizing the above code to obtain the pointer
# at which the left values are all smaller than the number at pointer index and vice versa
# for the right values.


def quicksort(l, r, nums):
	if len(nums) == 1: # Terminating Condition for recursion. VERY IMPORTANT!
		return nums
	if l < r:
		pi = partition(l, r, nums)
		quicksort(l, pi-1, nums) # Recursively sorting the left values
		quicksort(pi+1, r, nums) # Recursively sorting the right values
	return nums


example = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(quicksort(0, len(example)-1, example))

example = [2, 5, 6, 1, 4, 6, 2, 4, 7, 8]
result = [1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8]
# As you can see, it works for duplicates too
print(quicksort(0, len(example)-1, example))

# Time Complexity: Worst case time complexity is O(n**2) and average case time complexity is O(n*log(n))
# Auxiliary Space: O(1)

# Worst case is when the array is already sorted
""" Generally built-in sort function in programming languages are quick sort """
