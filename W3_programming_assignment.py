""" 3) A square nÃ—n matrix of integers can be written in Python as a list with n elements,
where each element is in turn a list of n integers, representing a row of the matrix. For instance, the matrix

  1  2  3
  4  5  6
  7  8  9
would be represented as [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]].

Write a function leftrotate(m) that takes a list representation m of a square matrix as input, and returns the matrix obtained by rotating the original matrix counterclockwize by 90 degrees. For instance, if we rotate the matrix above, we get
