""" Efficiency : Measure of time taken by an algorithm 
as a function T(n) with respect to input size n """

""" Big O notation
T(n) = O(n)
less time order:
log(n) < n < n*log(n) < n**2 < n**3 < 2**n < n! """

# Linear search efficiency is : O(n) for any lists
# Binary search efficiency is : O(log(n)) for sorted lists

" Python can do about 10**7 steps in 1 second"

" use command : 'time python3 W3_L3_efficiency.py' to get time taken in LINUX"
